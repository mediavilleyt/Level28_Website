        <h2>What is AI?</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human
          intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and
          mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that
          exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and
          problem-solving.
